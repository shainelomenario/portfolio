# Portfolio
Hi, welcome to my portfolio!! This is unofficially v2 of my personal portfoio that I made for my CSCI 355 class. 

## Process
Although I liked my original portfolio, I wanted something more sleek and minimalistic. Over the past few months I've been gaining experience in front end development via class and The Odin Project. Now that I'm more comfortable, I decided to go use vanilla HTML/CSS for this project.

For the design, I took inspirations from many modern portfolios and applied it through Canva. I proceeded to plan out the flexbox layout through CSS outlining. The rest was tedious CSS through researching.  

## Soon-Features
- Media Queries
- Dark Mode Functionality
